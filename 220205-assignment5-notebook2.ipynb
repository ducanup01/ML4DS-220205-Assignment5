    "# Assignment 5: Deep Learning {-}\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment aims at familiarizing you with training and testing a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The dataset you will be working on is CIFAR-10. You will have to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **(5 points) Coding tasks:** The following questions involve writing code to complete specific tasks.  \n",
    "    1.1 *(1 point)* Load the CIFAR-10 dataset, visualize sample images, and perform data normalization to improve training performance.  \n",
    "    1.2 *(1 point)* First network: Build, train, and test a deep neural network with at least three convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and two pooling layers.  \n",
    "    1.3 *(1 point)* Second network: Build, train, and test another deep neural network, with an architecture of your choice, but at most 4M (four million) parameters, ensuring the architecture meets this constraint by verifying with model.summary().  \n",
    "    1.4 *(2 points)* Modify the second network architecture by tuning the layer hyperparameters or adjusting the layer design to improve test accuracy while remaining within the four million parameter limit. Discuss your observations and the trade offs of the changes you make.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **(5 points) Open discussion questions:** These discussion questions ask you to analyze and argue your points.  Feel free to include relevant code examples to strengthen your arguments.  \n",
    "    2.1 *(1 point)* How did hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, dropout, batch size) affect your model’s accuracy? Were there any unexpected results?  \n",
    "    2.2 *(1 point)* How did the constraint of keeping the model within 4 million parameters impact your design choices? Would a larger model necessarily perform better?  \n",
    "    2.3 *(1 point)* How can deep learning models trained on datasets like CIFAR-10 be applied in real-world scenarios? Give an example.  \n",
    "    2.4 *(1 point)* Deep learning models for image recognition can have biases. What ethical concerns should be considered when deploying such models?  \n",
    "    2.5 *(1 point)* What was the most interesting or challenging part of this assignment? If you had more time, what additional improvements would you make?  \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset you will be working on is CIFAR-10 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) which consists of 60,000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Here follows the ten object classes:\n",
    "* airplane\n",
    "*\tautomobile\n",
    "*\tbird\n",
    "*\tcat\n",
    "*\tdeer\n",
    "*\tdog\n",
    "*\tfrog\n",
    "*\thorse\n",
    "*\tship\n",
    "*\ttruck\n",
    "\n",
    "Here follows some data samples in the dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/_images/cifar10.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission {-}\n",
    "The structure of submission folder should be organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ./\\<StudentID>-assignment5-notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing source code.\n",
    "- ./\\<Test-accuracy>-\\<StudentID>.txt: accuracy of the second network on the test set (for extra credit, see the 'Evaluation' part below). For example if you get 0.8124 accuracy, the name of this file is 08124-2012345.txt. The file content is left empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission folder is named ML4DS-\\<StudentID>-Assignment5 (e.g., ML4DS-2012345-Assigment5) and then compressed with the same name.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Evaluation {-}\n",
    "Assignment evaluation will be conducted on how you accomplish the assignment requirements. It is a plus if you have modeling steps other than the basic requirements and achieve an excellent model accuracy. In addition, your code should conform to a Python coding convention such as PEP-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXTRA CREDIT: Top-3 submissions achieving the highest test accuracy on the second network (of 4M params at most) will be rewarded an extra credit. **You have to ensure the architecture meets this constraint by verifying and printing out the number of parameters with model.summary(). Please follow the submission format to be eligible for this extra credit.**\n",
